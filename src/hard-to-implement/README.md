# Hard To Implement Features

There are many features that we would love to have in vexide, but don't have implemented.
Often these features are not implemented because they are very technical
or too hard to implement.
This chapter goes over these features and describes what we know about them,
why we haven't implemented them yet,
why we want them in the first place,
and possibly more depending on the feature.
