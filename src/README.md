# Overview

vexide internal documentation includes information for first time contributors,
technical details about features we want to implement,
technical explanations of already implemented features,
current priorities, and more. 

These docs are mainly for the vexide library, but the old pros-rs docs have been archived.

If you were looking for vexide user documentation,
you should go to the [main docs page](https://pros.rs/docs).
